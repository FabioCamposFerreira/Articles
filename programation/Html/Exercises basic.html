		 <p>Conteudo</p>
		 <p>The class tracks the progress of iterating over a matrix in its x and y properties. The next method starts by checking whether the bottom of the matrix
has been reached. If it hasn’t, it first creates the object holding the current
value and then updates its position, moving to the next row if necessary.<br />
Let’s set up the Matrix class to be iterable. Throughout this book, I’ll occasionally use after-the-fact prototype manipulation to add methods to classes
so that the individual pieces of code remain small and self-contained. In a regular program, where there is no need to split the code into small pieces, you’d
declare these methods directly in the class instead.
